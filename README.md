# Cellular-Automaton
A simple implementation of an epidemic model based on SIR and cellular automatons with graphics.
The model attemps to predict the geographical evolution of an epidemic through time on the base of a some parameters (basically SIR model parameters) and a simple map of population density among a certain area. 
The model has not been tested against real world cases yet. So, for now, it's only made for fun :)
